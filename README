Helpful commands I'm currently using in development and debugging. Perhaps they
will be someone illustrative of what this package is trying to do.

```bash

python -m graphid.demo.dummy_infr demodata_infr --show
python -m graphid.demo.dummy_infr demodata_infr --num_pccs=25 --show
python -m graphid.demo.dummy_infr demodata_infr --num_pccs=100 --show
```

This README is a mess. Why not look at [this Jupyter
notebook](notebooks/core_example.ipynb) in the meantime.


Conda can be used to install pygraphviz on windows?

conda install -c marufr pygraphviz

This project is Python 3.6+, Python 2 is not supported.
